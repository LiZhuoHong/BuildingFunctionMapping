# BuildingFunctionMapping
Buildings, as fundamental man-made structures in urban environments, serve as crucial indicators for understanding various city function zones. In this study, we proposed a semi-supervised framework to identify every building's function in large-scale urban areas with multi-modality remote-sensing data. In detail, optical images, building height LiDAR, and nighttime-light data are collected to describe the morphological attributes of buildings. Then, the area of interest (AOI) and building masks from the volunteered geographic information (VGI) data are collected to form sparsely labeled samples.
